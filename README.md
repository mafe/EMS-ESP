# EMS-ESP

EMS-ESP is a project to build an electronic controller circuit using an Espressif ESP8266 microcontroller to communicate with EMS (Energy Management System) based Boilers and Thermostats from the Bosch range and compatibles such as Buderus, Nefit, Junkers etc.

There are 3 parts to this project, first the design of the circuit, secondly the code for the ESP8266 microcontroller firmware with telnet and MQTT support, and lastly an example configuration for Home Assistant to monitor the data and issue direct commands via a MQTT broker.

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/proddy/EMS-ESP/wiki) for further documentation.
